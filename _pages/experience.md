# ðŸ”¬ Research Experience

## School of Statistics, Renmin University of China, Research Intern 
2025.02.11 â€“ 2025.05.16

Supervisor: [Prof. Feng Zhou](http://zhoufeng6288.github.io)

Projects: 
- **TPP-SD: Accelerating Transformer Point Process Sampling with Speculative Decoding**: Developed a novel framework that accelerates Transformer temporal point process sampling by adapting speculative decoding techniques from language models. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that TPP-SD produces samples from identical distributions as standard autoregressive methods, but with 2-6Ã— speedup.

## GSAI, Renmin University of China, Research Intern 
2024.03.08 â€“ 2025.01.21

Supervisor: [Prof. Hongteng Xu](https://hongtengxu.github.io)

Projects: 
- **USPTO-LLM (WWW 2025)**: Constructed the first chemical reaction dataset (USPTO-LLM, 247K entries) containing abundant reaction condition information by using LLM APIs to extract data from the USPTO patent database. Validated the dataset quality on graph-based and sequence-based retrosynthesis models. The dataset is open-sourced at [https://zenodo.org/records/14396156](https://zenodo.org/records/14396156).


# ðŸ’¼ Industry Experience

## Intuitive Fosun, R&D Intern

2025.01.15 â€“ 2025.02.15
- Leveraged OCR to extract high-frequency operating parameters from the transducer screen of the daVinci surgical robot. Processed video frames using OpenCV to minimize noise from parameter fluctuations, achieving an OCR accuracy of 99%.

- Trained a single-layer Transformer Encoder to extract and classify key information from 2,100 after-sales feedbacks of
daVinci surgical robots into 11 categories, which greatly helped after-sales engineers identify issues and provide solutions.
