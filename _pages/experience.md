# ðŸ”¬ Research Projects

## School of National Cyber Security, Wuhan University, Research Intern 
2023.09 â€“ 2024.2

Projects: 
- **Fundamental Theories of Data Security in Distributed Learning**: We implemented and analyzed three label inference attacks in federated learning: direct, active, and passive label inference attacka. Then we integrate defenses including gradient compression, gradient noise injection, and discretized SGD to thwart attacks. The system provides a security validation framework for benchmarking attack/defense methods in distributed systems.
  
The project was approved as a key sub-task under Chinaâ€™s 14th Five-Year Plan National Key R&D Program, Cyberspace Security Governance track. As a core member of the team, I lead work related to label inference attacks and defenses in vertical federated learning.
