This is a math-intensive **optimization methods** course lectured by [Prof. Feng Zhou](https://zhoufeng6288.github.io) from the School of Statistics, Renmin University of China. The course covers basic topics in optimization methods, including linear search methods, unconstrained optimization and constrained optimization.
